# numoop 
A header only C++ library for working with statistics and ordinary differential 
equations, built on top of [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/).

## What does numoop provide?
### DataFrame
The DataFrame object is similar to a Python Pandas dataframe. Each column is 
stored as an Armadillo Col object that can have its own type.
It's possible to have labels for each column which can also be used for indexing.
These features make a DataFrame perfect for working with various tabular data 
formats such as CSV files. 

Because a column in a DataFrame is just an Armadillo array, it's easy to use 
many statistical and numerical functions provided by Armadillo with a numoop 
DataFrame. One limitation of this however, is that it's not possible to store 
non-numeric data in the DataFrame. To get around this, categorical data must be 
converted to ints. The DataFrame object has methods for getting and setting a 
map which can map integer values to categories (strings).

#### CSV Loader
Numoop also provides a function that can load a CSV file into a DataFrame for 
you. The function automatically detects all types present in the data and even 
converts all categorical columns to integers. If a header is present in the CSV, 
the function can also automatically read it into the DataFrame.

Everything is user controllable, if you'd like to specify the type of each 
column yourself, you can pass this to the function. It's also possible to only 
load selected columns from the file and to provide custom newline and columns 
separator chars.

### ODE Solvers
Numoop provides the following ordinary differential equation solvers:
 - Forward-Euler
 - Runge Kutta 4
 - Midpoint

All methods work with both vector and scalar inputs. The solution is saved to a 
CSV file and also returned from the function.

## Using numoop
Since numoop is a header only library, using it is as simple as adding /src to 
your include directories. From here, if you want to use the whole module, you 
can include numoop.hpp. If you just want the stats module include stats/stats.hpp, 
and if you just want the ode module include ode/ode.hpp.

Armadillo must be installed on your system in some way as well.

## Compiling
While numoop itself does not need to be compiled, it comes with two files which 
can be compiled to test out the functionality of both modules. These can be 
compiled with the provided cmake file.
Before compiling, make sure you have BLAS and LAPACK installed, or a substitute 
such as OpenBLAS.

Make sure you're in the root directory of numoop and then run:
```bash
cmake .
make
```
Then you can run either test with:
```bash
./test_ode
```
or
```bash
./test_stats
```
```test_stats``` should be run from the project root, as it uses the dataset.csv 
file. 

While it's easy to set up cmake to be able to install the library, we have
avoided that approach here, as we don't expect any lecturer to install the 
library on their system.

### Bundled Armadillo
While it's not good to use Armadillo in header only mode in a production 
environment, we've included it in external/armadillo-code for your convenience.
The cmake script will use the bundled Armadillo if it can't find it on your 
system.

## Performance and other considerations
The performance of numoop is highly dependent on the libraries present on the 
system it's being run on. Specifically, the implementation of BLAS and LAPACK.
Having a multi-threaded library such as OpenBLAS greatly improves the performance
of Armadillo and therefore numoop.

### The cost of polymorphism
The polymorphic nature of the DataFrame object comes at a small cost. 
Specifically, certain templated functions need to be instantiated at compile 
time for every possible combination of numeric types numoop supports. This 
results in a slightly larger binary file. Additionally, columns are stored in 
std::variant objects, which reduces the indexing performance.
When performing large batch operations however, one only has to index the column 
once, after which the variant can be unpacked and there is no more performance 
loss.

### NaN values
Numoop uses IEEE NaN values, meaning that any NaN is considered the same regular 
numeric type present in the current column. This allows us to maintain a 
single type per column.

## Credits
Numoop was created by Christian Å pringer (christian.springer228@gmail.com) 
and Uros Zivanovic (chromeilion@outlook.com). Christian worked on the ODE module 
and Uros worked on the stats module. All collaboration was done through a 
repo on GitHub.
